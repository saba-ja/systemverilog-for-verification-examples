Sample 2.42
You can combine several variables into a structure. Sample 2.42 creates a structure
called pixel that has three unsigned bytes for red, green, and blue.

Use the suffi x “ _s ” when declaring a struct . This makes it easier to spot user-
defi ned types, simplifying the process of sharing and reusing code.
