Sample 2.55 and 2.56

An enumerated type allows you to create a set of related but unique constants such
as states in a state machine or opcodes.

An enumerated type is stored as int unless you specify other-
wise. Be careful when assigning values to enumerated constants,
as the default value of an int is 0.
