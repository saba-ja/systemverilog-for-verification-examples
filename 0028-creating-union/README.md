Unions are useful when you frequently need to read and write a
register in several different formats. However, donâ€™t go overboard,
especially just to save memory. Unions may help squeeze a few
bytes out of a structure, but at the expense of having to create and
maintain a more complicated data structure. Instead, make a class
