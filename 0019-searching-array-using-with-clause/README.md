Sample 2.30

You could search through an array using a foreach loop, but SystemVerilog can
do this in one operation with a locator method. The with expression tells
SystemVerilog how to perform the search, as shown in Sample 2.30 . These methods
return an empty queue if the value you are searching for does not exist in the array.
