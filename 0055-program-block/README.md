Sample 4.18

Your test should be contained in a single program. You should use
OOP to build a dynamic, hierarchical testbench from objects instead
of modules. A simulation may have multiple program blocks if you
are using code from other people or combining several tests.

As discussed in Section 3.6.1, you should always declare your pro-
gram block as automatic so that it behaves more like the routines
in stack-based languages you may have worked with, such as C.
